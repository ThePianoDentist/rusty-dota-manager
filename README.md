# rusty-dota-manager
Work on a 2d match-engine for a football manager style game but applied to DotA

Work abandoned as the AI stuff is quite tricky, maybe DotA2 should have some reasonably working bots before attempting to do the same thing here.
It seems like a fully text-based match-engine with lots of shortcuts is necessary
(I realised this level of accuracy was unreasonable early on but was having a lot of fun learning rust)

Due to a font C++ library having issues on windows was only ever able to build on linux

video of it in action as an idea of what it would have looked like
